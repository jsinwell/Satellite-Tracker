TO DO:
    Geocoder widget on the left side of Cesium viewer, which gets user's coordinates and displays satellites that are currently visible
        -Possibly form a "cylindrical radius" of x miles around a specific location, and if any entities are within radius, display it

    Color code based on type of satellite

    Draw orbital path around satellite when clicked


IN PROGRESS:
    Improve loading times when full TLE data is used
        - store TLE data in map: [key: name, value: orbital data]

COMPLETED:
    Add filtered search bar functionality, which dynamically updates possible list of satellites from user input

    Sidebar for turning on/off certain Cesium features, such as background image
